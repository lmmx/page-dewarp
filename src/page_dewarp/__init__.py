"""Page-dewarp: a document image dewarping library using a cubic sheet model.

This package offers functionality for:
- Dewarping scanned pages (using a cubic sheet model).
- Thresholding to produce clear, high-contrast page images.
- Optional PDF merging and other image manipulation features.

It is a refactored version of Matt Zucker's original (2016) Python 2 script,
updated for Python 3.9+ and packaged for easy installation from PyPI.

Dependencies include NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, and msgspec.
See the project's README for a complete list of installation and usage details.
