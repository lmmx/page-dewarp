# API Reference

Welcome to the API Reference for **page-dewarp**!

Below, you'll find documentation for the library’s primary modules and classes. These pages are
generated from the source code and include details on function signatures, class methods, and
parameters used throughout the project. If you're looking for a deeper understanding of how
page-dewarp processes, dewarps, and thresholds images, you've come to the right place.

Use the navigation panel on the left to explore each module. You’ll see how to:
- Initialize and configure the library via the `options` module,
- Detect and manipulate contours and spans,
- Warp images using the cubic sheet model,
- And more!

If you're new to the project, you may want to start with the main [Get Started](../get_started.md)
guide.
